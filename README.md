### Hi there 👋


🔭 I’m a passionate JavaScript Developer.
💻 My development stack includes React.js for frontend and Node.js for backend.
🌱 I actively use Git to manage public and private repositories efficiently.
👯 I’m always open to collaborating with Senior JavaScript Developers to grow and share knowledge.
🤔 For troubleshooting, I rely on Stack Overflow or ChatGPT to find effective solutions.
😏 Alongside development, I specialize in automation testing, primarily End-to-End (E2E) testing.
😏 Depending on the client's requirements, I utilize Cypress or Playwright for E2E automation testing.
⚡ Fun fact: I’m all about caring, loving, and helping others—especially in coding. Collaboration is my superpower!
🙂 I’m constantly eager to explore and learn the latest technologies to stay ahead in the field.
